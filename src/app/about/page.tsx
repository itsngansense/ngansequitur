        <h1>hi, i&apos;m ngan</h1>
        <p>hint: it&apos;s pronounced <em>&apos;naan&apos;</em> — like the bread</p>
        <p>multidisciplinary designer who loves code, puns, and donuts. advocate for diversity and inclusion in tech. building great and intuitive products that make people&apos;s lives easier is what i&apos;m most passionate about. i have 10+ years of experience strategizing innovative digital experiences for small startups to high-profile brands. i&apos;m currently based in Austin, Texas, but spent most of my years in the DMV.</p>
        <p>I&apos;m a designer, researcher, and artist who cares deeply about diversity, inclusivity, and equity. Most recently, I graduated from UT Austin in May 2022 with a Master of Arts degree in Design, focused on Health.</p>
        <p>Over the last decade, I&apos;ve dedicated my efforts designing intuitive products and advocating for more human-centric and accessible solutions within the tech industry. However, I think I got my start in design much earlier in life.</p>
        <p>As early as seven years old, I can remember creating processes to help make it easier for my parents to navigate the United States&apos; complicated healthcare system. Growing up with immigrant and refugee parents, I was often faced with the task of bridging any cultural barriers and language gaps in order to provide them with the agency to make their own life and health choices. I believe that everyone is deserving of this agency, no matter what their situation is, but understand that this level of support is substantial and not something that many have easy access to.</p>
        <p>I&apos;ve always felt a calling to support others in ways they cannot do for themselves and advocate for their needs. Aside from my family, I&apos;ve had the opportunity to assist people with a wide set of special needs, serving as a <a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/neighborhood-community-services/therapeutic-recreation">Therapeutic Recreation Camp</a> Counselor for individuals with disabilities as well as a Personal Aide for someone on the Autism spectrum.</p>
        <p>In the wake of the current health crisis, I&apos;ve seen first-hand how healthcare systems and supporting technologies can exclude people in need of help, particularly those who are most vulnerable. My goal is to become a catalyst for positive social impact and change that will drive healthcare systems to shift in the direction of more value-based, culturally-sensitive, and integrated care that puts an emphasis on health and wellness, not just care.</p>
        <p>When it comes to health/life, there is no “edge case” or “target audience,” which is why I&apos;ve devoted my career to creating intuitive, engaging, and accessible solutions. Based on the lessons I&apos;ve learned from my own family, it&apos;s my understanding that empathetic, thoughtful, and solution-oriented designs could be the answer to creating a more compassionate ecosystem of health and care.</p>
