        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurological disorder that is one of the most common conditions in children, and is often further complicated by existing co-morbidities with overlapping symptoms. Initially measured only by the presence of hyperactivity in children, the American Psychiatric Association&apos;s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth edition (DSM-5) now includes inattentiveness with studies suggesting persistence of symptoms through the lifespan.</p>
        <p>Overall understanding and awareness of ADHD has evolved significantly over the years and continues to improve. However, stigma, stereotypes, and outdated gender role expectations still persist today and contributes to the lack of proper and accurate ADHD research, detection, diagnoses and treatment for women and girls. While the prevalence of ADHD is similar by gender, men and boys are far more commonly diagnosed—nearly 69% more likely— than women and girls in the United States due to perpetuating and harmful ADHD myths. Recent research predicts individuals who are inadequately evaluated, diagnosed, or treated are highly likely to experience serious mental and physical health implications and outcomes. </p>

        <h3>design challenge</h3>
        <p>How might we close the gender gap in ADHD diagnoses to ensure women and girls can easily access the proper treatment and quality care that they need?</p>

        <h2>Methods and Tools</h2>
        <h3>Ladder of Inference</h3>
        <p>As a woman living with ADHD, having been undiagnosed until later in adulthood (in 2018, when I was 28), it felt important for me to use the Ladder of Inference as a tool to help me be more self-aware of my own biases. Before utilizing any other research tools, I wanted to ensure that I approached my research surrounding the gender gap in ADHD diagnoses and treatment from an objective standpoint, testing my assumptions along the way.</p>
        <h4>Key Insights</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Research has shown that women and girls (compared to men and boys) are consistently under-identified and under-diagnosed for ADHD using the current DSM- V criteria, with the top two factors for the disparity being that women mostly exhibit inattentive presentations and are highly motivated to hide their ADHD symptoms and compensate for them. New DSM criteria for detecting and diagnosing ADHD needs to consider the perspectives of women/girls and the different ways that ADHD presents individuals across the spectrum and across the life span, not just the outdated stereotypes that ADHD is a childhood and male disorder.</li>
          <li>More women and girls should be recruited and involved in research and studies. Gaining insights from multiple perspectives can help us to form a more systemic understanding the ADHD spectrum, which in turn might offer an opportunity to discover common ground (shared needs, values and beliefs) which can help us detect and recognize ADHD symptoms in both men/boys and women/girls and refer them to thorough assessments to obtain proper diagnoses and treatment. This will ultimately lead to better health outcomes in more equitable, inclusive, participatory ways while helping close the gender and age gap in ADHD diagnoses.</li>
        </ol>
        <hr/>
        <h3>Iceberg Model</h3>
        <p>Using the Iceberg Model will allow me to further shift my perspectives to see beyond my own personal experiences as well as the immediate events that are universally recognized and acknowledged surrounding the ADHD gender gap. It will help uncover the root causes of why women and girls are often un- or under- diagnosed for ADHD by taking a deeper look into the existing structures responsible for trends and patterns that have evolved and persisted over time, exposing the underlying societal mental models that need to shift.</p>
        <h4>Key Insights</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Due to outdated gender role expectations,women and girls tend to mask and/or internalize their ADHD symptoms — which is why it consistently gets overlooked or misdiagnosed— and attributes to the disparity in ADHD diagnoses and treatment. Recent studies have shown that women and girls are also highly motivated to overcompensate for their symptoms, putting them at higher risk of social isolation and engaging in risky behavior,leading to poor health outcomes.</li>
          <li>ADHD is a spectrum disorder with its presentations in women and girls leaning more towards symptoms and presentations of inattentiveness, which differ from their male counterparts, who typically display hyperactivity and impulsivity. This is a stereotype ofADHD that persists — despite new research findings and data that challenge it— and contributes to gender and referral bias. Along with many other factors, these barriers make it more difficult for women/girls to receive thorough assessments and appropriate diagnoses or treatment.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>Based on my findings from the <strong>Ladder of Inference</strong> and <strong>Iceberg Model</strong> exercises, there are five recommended interventions I am proposing:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Recruit more women/girls as well as people of color to participate in research studies about ADHD. This will lead to a more holistic view of the ADHD spectrum,and lead to more accurate detection and diagnoses ofADHD in women and girls.</li>
          <li>Develop a shared language and common understanding of the ADHD spectrum,including symptoms,causes, risks, and characteristics — beyond the genetic factors.</li>
          <li>Update DSM diagnostic criteria based on research and data involving perspectives outside of the behaviors & experiences of men/boys. Standardize testing to be more accessible and inclusive.</li>
          <li>Increase awareness and advocacy around the differences in how ADHD presents itself across the spectrum and lifespan. This will help facilitate conversations and develop a shared understanding of the causes/risks of ADHD among stakeholders, ultimately gaining more buy- in and reducing stigma by shifting mental models.</li>
          <li>Require unconscious bias training for clinicians and educators, to help eliminate gender bias when detecting and referring children who present ADHD symptoms to the support they need. Equip clinicians and educators with ways to provide resources to parents and also screen parents, as it is known be hereditary.</li>
        </ol>
